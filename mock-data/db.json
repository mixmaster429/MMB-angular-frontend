So, instead of easing into the electric field with another battery-powered hatchback like the Focus Electric, Ford is aggressively entering into the EV market by leveraging the Mustang name and applying it to this all-electric five-passenger crossover. Whether that was a smart move or damaging to the Mustang's legendary status remains to be seen and tested."

Goalkeepers are the players that make difference in a team. You may have an excellent team on field but thinking that you won't get attacked once in goal in 90′ is not at all possible. You'll get attacked and that's were Goalkeepers make the difference And the biggest difference between a keeper and other player is that the blame on conceding is always on keeper because he's the last man! A Goalkeeper needs to have high level of attentiveness, if he switches off in the wrong minute he concedes. He has to lead a whole pack of 4 defenders in front of him(Extremaly difficult for a young lad). He needs to have amazing reflex and skill and distribution. Without any doubt, it's the position only special people can play in.</li><li>CDM - Central Defensive Midfielder : A CDM role is very clear to see. He needs to Defend, Chase, distribute, construct an Attack, support midfield and Defence, win headers…. Okay do everything. CDM role one can say is the most versatile role to play. You need to have everything in a lot quantity in you to be a CDM. That's why I've never witnessed a perfect CDM since Mekelele. Its a role that demands physically too. You need to have Strength to hold of attackers in first place. You need to have speed to chase. Need perfect passing skills to continue distribution. You need to be calm because 2 lines, attack and Defence are instructing you what you do. You need to have Stamina because you're going everything!</li></ol><p><strong>Not only because of skill these are the two most difficult, because of the fact that the blame of a team conceding is directly put on these players. </strong>And even if you perform brilliantly these players don't get credit, because in the end it's all bout who scored a goal (Sad truth of Football).</p>"
